Libraries used- Pandas, Matplotlib

Workflow-
1. Extracting movie data released in 1990s
2. Identifying the most frequent duration of the movie as "Duration" where duration > 120
3. Data visualization of "Duration"
4. Now we will extract data based on genre='Action', duration < 90 & released_year: 1990 <= x <= 1999
